## Setup and Development


#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

To begin, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Era-Creator/arcane-app
```

---



#### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
Next, navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment. This will isolate the project's dependencies from your system-wide Python installation. Run the following command:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

---


#### Step 4: Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, you can now install the project dependencies. The required packages are listed in the requirements.txt file. Run the following command to install them:
```bash

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

---

#### Step 5: Start the Development Server
Now that you have completed all the setup steps, you can start the development server. Run the following command:
```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```
Allow the server to start, 1-3 minutes, then navigate to the login url and use demo account.

http://localhost:8000/login/
